* When a component had multiple parents, and there was a draft version of that
  component, you received an error when trying to export the course. This
  problem is resolved. (PLAT-332)

* When working with a rerun course, if you tried to preview changes when
  editing a unit, you received an error. This problem is resolved. (PLAT-336)

* You can now use a new advanced setting, ``always_cohort_inline_discussions``,
  to control whether content-specific discussion topics are unified or
  cohorted.  See `Make All Content-Specific Discussion Topics Unified by
  Default`_ for more information.

* The inline help for the advanced setting is updated to note that discussion
  IDs must be unique. (TNL-752)
