The following information reflects what is new in edX Studio as of January 7, 2015.

* If a user who has completed the verification process enrolled as a verified
  student before the verification expires, but the course's verification
  deadline was after the user's verification expires, the student was
  erroneously prompted to verify his or her identity.  This problem is
  resolved. (ECOM-864)

* Students using Internet Explorer 9 without Flash installed were able to click
  disabled buttons and proceed through the verification process, though no
  photo is taken. Students are now unable to proceed until they install Flash.
  (ECOM-849)
